I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

We on our way back, we on a playback
We want some new plus, oh, never change that
We on a new tip, good music
We see the pen and the paper, we gonna use it
It takes a late night, to get them bright lights
We keep writing them songs, to live that good life
I do it for you, I do it for me
We break it down, Colbie, tell them the story

Listen, can you hear me?
Am I coming in on your frequency?
I got a story
Subject of the plot, you and me
(Yeah) and when you're sleeping, and when you're waking
And when you're feeling good
I'll be the thing that, you want to sing back
Stuck in your head like I knew you would

I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (hey)

I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head, when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

You'll be singing like
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) turn it up (hey)
Turn it up (you'll be singing like)

Baby, can you feel me?
I'm the kick drum that gets your heart to beat
I gotta have you near me
You can count me into every song I sing

When you're sleeping, and when you're waking
And when you're feeling good (feel good)
I'll be the one that you want to come back
Stuck in your head like I knew I would

We on our way back, we on a playback
We on some new plus, oh, never change that
We on our way back, we on a playback
Play back, play back, play back

I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (hey!)
I wanna be your melody (yeah)
Flowing through your head, when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

You'll be singing like (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Turn it up (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) turn it up, turn it up
You'll be singing like (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Turn it up (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Girl, the songs you sing, they my favorite things
You stay in my dreams
Something supreme

Love is the key, and it's made your life see
Common and Colbie, I'm dusting off the old me
Like the OLB, we call 'em oldies
In your melodies, I'm hearing things you never told me

We stay in tune with each other
In our room we'll discover new ways to do covers
No matter how they dub us
We should stay true to the trust
And the winner of the best duo is us, uh

I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (hey!)

I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head, when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La, la, la, la, la

You'll be singing like (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Turn it up (hey!), turn it up, turn it up (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Turn it up, turn it up y'all (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) ah yeah

All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
I just wanna sing it to you everyday
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
La, la, la, la, la
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
I just wanna sing it to you everyday
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna say is
La, la, la, la, la
