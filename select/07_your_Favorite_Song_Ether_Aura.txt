In a dream I had last night
I know I saw you
We were chasing sweeping clouds
And then I fell through

You can't show such sweetness
You can't save me with your song
I have exposed my weakness
And you may drown

I almost gave up
And you made a promise
That you'd never leave me
We play like we used to
And try to be honest
It's just like a movie

I will play your favourite song
And when you notice
You won't have to say a thing
We speaking silence

You can't show such sweetness
You can't save me with your song
I have exposed my weakness
And you may drown

I almost gave up
And you made a promise
That you'd never leave me
We play like we used to
And try to be honest
It's just like a movie

I almost gave up
And you made a promise
That you'd never leave me
We play like we used to
And try to be honest
It's just like a movie
