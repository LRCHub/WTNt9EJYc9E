That's my favorite song.
Let it play on and on and on
That's my favorite song
Let it play all night long.

That's my favorite song.
Let it play on and on and on
That's my favorite song
And we'll keep getting it on.

It's a plain and simple song
And the atmosphere is here
Good vibrations are near
And I wanna make love to you my dear

That's the same sweet song
That played the night we first got it on
Ooooh, we got it on and on and on and on and on

That's my favorite song
Let it play on and on and on

Let it play all night long

That's my favorite song.

And we'll keep getting it on
To my favorite song
We'll keep getting it on
To my favorite song
We'll keep making love
To my favorite song

Taking me high as a kite
Girl your love is burning fire tonight
Girl, I'm on fire tonight
Got to release this heavy load
In a minute I'm gonna explode all over you
Yah yah yah yah yah yah yah

That's my favorite song
Let it play on and on and on
That's my favorite song
Let it play all night long

That's my favorite song
Let it play on and on and on
That's my favorite song
And we'll keep getting it on
